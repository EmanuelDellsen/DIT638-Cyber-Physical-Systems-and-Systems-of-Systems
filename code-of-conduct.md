# Code of conduct
## How do we plan to collaborate?

* The team will be using Gitlab-board and Trello-board for task management.
* To be able to plan and assign the version controlled tasks we will use a Gitlab board with issues. Each issue represents a task to be solved with code. 
* All administrative work will be organized using a Trello-board. Administrative tasks such as booking presentation slots, creating SRS requirements and architectural diagrams will also be created here and assigned with the respective team members as well as assignments from canvas.
* Issues on both the Trello and the Gitlab-board go through the following stages:
    * Open. The task that has been created. These are ideas that come up during development or testing which can be added without discussion with other team members. These tasks (together will the tasks on the Trello board will form the basis for the agenda of the weekly meeting.
    * To-Do. A breakdown of tasks from “Open” into smaller tasks where these tasks will be processed and assigned to at least one developer.
    * Doing. The task a developer is currently working on. 
    * Closed. Tasks that have either been completed (from “Doing”) or scrapped tasks from “Open”.
* We keep a project calendar with several project milestones with defined deadlines (such as concept presentation, final report, final implementation).
* Our plan is to implement the code with the use of pair programming. We will alternate these pairs from week to week, making sure everyone works with everyone. We believe that this alteration within the pairs will create a cross-collaborate team and in combination with the fact that we are a small group of 4 members we have decided that it isn’t necessary to assign any group leader.  To allow pair programming remotely we will use an extension for VS Code called “Live Share” to edit and view code on the same screen while we use Discord to communicate.
* To address the risk of unexpected delays of certain tasks, the team has landed on the following plan:
    * Team is one step ahead. The team will plan for completing assignments and tasks one week prior to the week of submission and thereby allows a bit of margin of error. Our shared calendar will also be adjusted to easter-break and other national holidays.
    * In case of a team member being complete with the tasks that are assigned to that member for the work week, the team member should check if there are any uncompleted tasks on the boards and offer assistance to the team members assigned for eventual uncompleted tasks and thereby adding extra resources where needed.
    * In the event that a task does get delayed, those working on the delayed task will seek assistance from other members in the team where there will be a combined effort to ensure the delayed task can be completed on time. 
    * During the team meeting on Mondays when assigning tasks for the coming work week, the team will make sure to proportionally assign tasks to members so that one or more members are not overloaded with work for that week.


## How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?
* Every contribution that is possible to version control will be tracked by creating issues on the Gitlab board. These will be assigned to the respective developer and moved forward from TO-DO to Closed using Git.
* For the administrative tasks kept on Trello, we assign individual team members to the tasks and move these from Doing to Done.
* We are further using a Google Form where each of us do daily reports of the work being done. The report goes into a spreadsheet that is shared among the members in the group, making it possible to stay informed about the work of the others.
* The team will handle individual assignments as a group task in terms of management on the teams board. This does not mean that the individual assignments will be solved as a group activity but rather that the issue concerning the individual assignments will be completed once all of the team members' individual assignments are completed. 

## How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?
* By conducting pair programming
* Adding links of knowledge sources to our Trello-board into a “Fountain of Knowledge”
* During the sessions and meetings with voice communication through Discord will have opportunities to ask questions and figure out answers together unless someone can answer immediately. 
* Aim to comment as much as possible in our code to ensure that everyone understands what is going on and as a result have knowledge transferred.
* Turn questions and problems into practical documents with information, templates etc and add links to those in the “Fountain of Knowledge” on our Trello-board.
* The team will use a shared Google calendar for lecture times, post-lectures meetings, meetings, deadlines of assignments and other time-related issues.

## What is our usual communication plan?
* Our main communication platform will be Discord. 
* Team meetings will be held via Discord on Mondays and Wednesdays every week to discuss open issues from the Gitlab issues board and Trello-board.
* Specifically on Mondays the team will devise a plan for the week's task and assign team members to those tasks - following the template for weekly meetings.
* These meetings will also include stand up meetings where the team will receive updates on the current tasks team members are working on and their plans to accomplish before the next meeting. Additional post lecture meetings will also be held via Discord on tuesdays and thursdays.
* Furthermore, team members will be available on Discord outside meeting hours to provide assistance to other team members who may be experiencing difficulties with some tasks.
* Communication between pairs for pair programming will be determined by each pair on where and when they will carry out their tasks.

## How will we solve conflicts? 
* Discussions on progress and assigning tasks will be done during the weekly meetings. If there are conflicting opinions regarding progress and assignment of tasks the team will vote and the option with the most votes will be the option that the team moves forward with. If there is a stalemate, the team will use flip-a-coin and the youngest person of the group will decide what option corresponds to either heads or tails. 
* Preferably discussions and decisions that need to be addressed will be left to this meeting and other decisions that might come up will be up to the developers themselves to solve. 
* Given the situation where a lot of work is being done over the internet, to avoid that conflicts arise out of misunderstandings it is essential to follow our communication plan
* If any of the team members feels that another team member is not contributing as expected, the team member should address this during the weekly meeting. If there has not been any improvement in contribution by the next weekly meeting, this should be addressed once again. If there's yet again no improvement in contribution by the following meeting, the course coordinator will be contacted and informed of the issue. The team member who has not been contributing will be informed that the course coordinator has been contacted. 

## General schedule for a work week
